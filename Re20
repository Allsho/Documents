As a Data Architect at Yale New Haven Hospital, my role continues to center around delivering high-quality, accurate, and timely data solutions that support patients, providers, and business users. In 2024, I embraced a wide range of responsibilities, tackling complex challenges and consistently meeting deadlines and commitments. I have further honed my communication skills by leading meetings more effectively to achieve a shared understanding of objectives and to foster strong working relationships with users and clients. Additionally, I have collaborated with colleagues across multiple projects, assisting in tasks like teaching, writing documentation, and providing support. On top of that, I continue to work with applications such as Epic Clarity, Caboodle, and SlicerDicer, as well as programming languages to help further automation. This includes MySQL, SQL Server, C#, Bash, and Python. My work this year spanned regular meetings, developing and maintaining Epic DMCs, and providing critical support for scripts, documentation, and various applications.
In 2024, I took on increased responsibilities in my role, managing weekly meetings with Epic representatives on topics ranging from Caboodle infrastructure, upgrades, administration, and SlicerDicer development. My work with the Pop Health team also expanded to include discussions on Caboodle enhancements, database management, claims-related inquiries, and support for third-party vendors. I have continued to take the lead in coordinating development and support with these third-party vendors, furthering our team’s collaboration. Additionally, I have led and provided ongoing support to the SlicerDicer/JDAT team by developing custom enhancements to improve their model-building processes. Moreover, I have collaborated regularly with the Office of Health Strategy to advance and support all payor claims data.
In my ongoing work with the SlicerDicer and JDAT teams, I continued to lead development in Caboodle, creating new custom DMCs and building upon Epic-released DMCs requiring custom packages, stored procedures, and SSIS loads. My work includes leveraging complex ID/Foreign Key relationships, auxiliary cleanup procedures, and intricate Clarity load scripts to produce robust calculated results.
My role remains heavily focused on developing processes and databases to create clean, accessible data structures for users and departments. For claims related work, I continued to process NEMG Payor Claim Data and provide CUD Analysis, including data ingestion and normalization for Caboodle and JDAT reporting. My responsibilities for claims also include transferring data to third-party vendors such as HDI, Arcadia, and ICS, and moving cleaned, normalized datasets into Comm Spec and performing daily/weekly audits to ensure data integrity. I have continued my work in claims ingestion, helping with patient matching to bridge care gaps.
In maintaining Epic Caboodle, I continued to monitor nightly executions, keep File Information updated, maintain component configurations, clean up external sources and variables, and ensure DMCs are current and backfilled. My work on Caboodle also involves collaboration with a fellow architect to coordinate upgrades and align Caboodle with Clarity, enhancing system efficiency and reducing error rates. This ongoing partnership helps maintain a robust and precise Caboodle data warehouse.
In addition to my primary responsibilities around claims, Caboodle and SlicerDicer, I supported and enhanced several other major projects in 2024, including:


New:
•	Yale Health Plan: Coordinate between Yale Health members to build out historical and daily incremental clinical data feeds to support business requirements.   
•	HEDIS: Worked with Epic TS to build out the HEDIS measures and modules in Caboodle REL/Production in order to improve healthcare quality.
•	Surgeon First Case/RXHealth: Worked with Leslie and Ron, to build out a fully automated process to alert physicians when there first cases are the next day.
•	Yale Medicine Claims: Continue to work with Population Health and Value Base members from YM to begin ingesting YM claims data as well as orchestrate data feeds to third party vendors.
•	CashApp: Converted and moved the CashControl Access database into SQL Server, by preserving the table structure and data quality.
Maintaining:
•	Inventory Asset Management: Expanded the MaaS360 API and SCCM data source, adding integrations for Aeroscout, Intune, Jamf, WMS, ATT, Verizon, and additional sources to the existing Webi database.
•	Pyxis Pharmaceutical: Continued support and reporting for the database.
•	Arcadia/HDI/Yale: Built a connector and ETL process to send Clarity data to Arcadia, supporting NEMG Claims transfers.
•	ITS Training Dashboard: Maintained and enhanced data pulls.
•	OHS – APCD: Ongoing support, enhancement, and data loads for the All-Payor Claims Database.
•	Epic Caboodle: Cleaned up unused sources, updated component configurations, managed custom data, and partnered with Zia for upgrades and Nova Note management.
In conclusion, I remain committed to supporting the growth and goals of our organization. I will continue to build upon my knowledge and expertise, striving to provide invaluable support to patients, providers, leadership, and business users in achieving their objectives.
