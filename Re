As part of my role as a Data Architect at Yale New Haven Hospital, my core focus is to deliver high quality, accurate, and quick work to assist patients, providers, and business users. This year is no different, as I’ve taken on numerous challenges while meeting deadlines and commitments. At the same time, I continue to improve on my communication skills when conducting meetings in order to achieve better understanding of the work while maintaining a strong working relationship with the user/client. Furthermore, I’ve assisted fellow co workers on projects and tasks that include teaching, writing documentation, and offering help on applications such as Epic Clarity, Caboodle, and SlicerDicer. As well as programming languages to help with problems and improve automation, such as MySql, SQLServer, C#, and Python. This past year my work varied from conducting weekly/biweekly/monthly meetings, developing Epic DMCs, writing and maintaining scripts, documentation, and supporting programs and applications.
	With the increase of responsibilities in my role, I managed successful weekly meetings with Epic representatives that ranged from focusing and discussing Caboodle Infrastructure, Upgrades, Administration, and SlicerDicer development. In addition, I worked with the Pop Health team to discuss Caboodle enhancements, database management, claims related inquiries, and third-party vendor support. On top of that, I made sure to take charge when discussing development and support with our third-Party Vendors. Furthermore, I continue to lead and provide development support to the SlicerDicer/JDAT team by building out custom enhancements to assist on their models. Lastly, I worked with the Office of Health Strategy on a routine basis to develop and support all payor claims data.
	As mentioned previously, I continue to lead and assist the Slicer Dicer and JDAT team on Caboodle development such as creating brand new custom DMCs, and or building off Epic Released DMCs that required custom packages, stored procedures, and SSIS loads. My work includes many custom DMCs that leverage many ID/Foreign Keys, Auxiliary cleanup stored procedures, complex Clarity load scripts and in-depth expressions for calculated results.
	Much of my work revolves around developing processes and databases to provide clean and clear data structures for users and departments. For Claims related work, I continue to support and process NEMG Payor Claim Data and provide CUD Analysis. These processes include data ingestion and normalizing data sets for Caboodle and JDAT reporting. Furthermore, there are processes in place to move data/file sets to third party vendors such as HDI, Arcadia, and ICS. As well as, moving clean normalized data sets into Comm Spec and Auditing conditions on a daily/weekly basis. I’m also continuing to support claims ingestion to help with patient matching to close gaps in care. On top of NEMG, I will now be supporting, YM Claim files such as Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Wellcare, Optimus, and many more. 
	Lastly, I continue to manage the Epic Caboodle application that involves monitoring Nightly, keeping the File Information up to date, maintaining the component configuration, cleaning up the external sources and variables, and making sure the DMCs are backfilled and current. In addition, I work closely with a fellow Architect to upgrade the Caboodle environment as well as coordinate with the Clarity Admins to properly align both systems and reduce errors and slow execution times. I will continue to work closely with Zia to maintain an efficient and accurate Caboodle data warehouse.
	Ongoing projects excluding Claims and SlicerDicer work, that are becoming larger, the following I continue to enhance and maintain.
•	Inventory Asset Management – Continue to build on the MaaS360 API and the SCCM data source.
o	Currently working with the end users to expand the existing Webi database, by adding Aeroscout, Intune, Jamf, WMS, ATT, Verizon, and much more sources. 
•	Pyxis Pharmaceutical – Continuing to support and provide reports for this database.
•	Arcadia/Yale – Supporting NEMG Claims transfers.
o	Currently building a connector and ETL to send Clarity data to Arcadia.
•	ITS Training Dashboard – Currently maintaining and enhancing the data pulls.
•	OHS – APCD – Continuing to load, support, and enhance the All-Payor Claims Database.
•	Epic Caboodle – Continue to clean up the application by removing unused sources, updating component configurations, loading up to date Custom Data, and working closely with Zia to do upgrades and manage Nova Notes.
	In conclusion, I will continue to strive to help the organization grow and build upon my knowledge to better assist patients, providers, leadership, and business users on achieving their goals.
